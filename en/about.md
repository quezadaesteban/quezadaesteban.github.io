Ezteven blog is maintained by myself, Esteban Quezada. I study at the Technological University of Panama and I dedicate myself to the development of web and mobile applications for public institutions and individuals.

I write on this blog in my free time. I do this as a way to better organize my ideas, to investigate topics that are of interest to me and as a method of bringing knowledge that I consider relevant to people who may find it useful.

You can contact me by writting to this email [ezteven@outlook.com](mailto:ezteven@outlook.com)
