# Procrastinate is really easy to do

Procrastinating is something very easy to do. It even becomes something that we do voluntarily. We all have things to do and reasons that motivate us to do them, however, that is not always enough to give us that push we need.

Normally everything starts with a thought of something that has to be done that ends up evolving in all the things that we will need to be able to do it, not in a positive way, by the way, but rather as a set of obstacles that exist to even begin. The interesting thing about this is that most are mental obstacles, not in the sense that they do not exist in real life, but in that they exist but are not as important or relevant as our mind imagines them.

_Sometimes just getting up and doing things is all we need. Without thinking, just doing it, makes a big difference._

In my case every time I think about what I have to do and what that involves, it becomes more likely that I will not do it. Just knowing that I have to do it, go and execute, changes the situation drastically.
