When we talk to others, something that would be useful to keep in mind is that we don't have to be right. Who would like to talk to someone who always thinks he is right? Communicating with others allows us to expand our vision of things, communicate our points of view, correct and be corrected.

Communicating freely without the fear of being humiliated or offended because of out mistakes, makes us more human and opens the way to more enriching conversations, that is because it gives other people the possibility to express their points of view without fear of being rejected.
